Do i need a rl table?

check for mailboxes that are not created yet
ability to delete mailboxes
show the endpoint url
only parse the templates you need to
browser alerts
copy to clipboard when click endpoint
delete old websocket connections

get rid of auto inc on requests table, order by timestamp
think of limits on the requests table, maybe casandra?

delete requests that havent been updated in a while

remember last few urls with javascript and link in header
